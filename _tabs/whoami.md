I've spent the past decade navigating the world of IT and cybersecurity—starting from humble beginnings in helpdesk to diving deep into network engineering, security operations centers and now cyber threat intelligence. Whether it's collecting and analyzing intelligence, supporting incident response, or fine-tuning security tools to meet ever-evolving challenges, I thrive in the intricate world of cybersecurity.

I am currently attempting to write in an attempt to explore, explain, and sometimes just make sense of this complex landscape. This blog is my space to dive into cybersecurity, threat intelligence, AI, and whatever else piques my curiosity. Whether you're here for deep technical dives or just to see what’s on my mind, I hope you find something that resonates.
